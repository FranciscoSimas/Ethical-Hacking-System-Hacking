# Ethical Hacking System Hacking Documentation

## Overview

This project involves creating a network of virtual machines on AWS to demonstrate the use of Responder for capturing network authentication requests. The primary objectives include setting up VMs with different operating systems, configuring Responder to capture credentials, and using John the Ripper to analyze captured data for password vulnerabilities.

## Lab Scenario

For professional ethical hackers or pen testers, gaining access to a target system involves exploiting vulnerabilities in the system's access control mechanisms. This phase typically includes password cracking, vulnerability exploitation, and potentially social engineering techniques to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive information.

## Lab Objectives

- **Demonstrate Network Authentication Capture:** Use Responder to intercept and analyze authentication requests on the network.
- **Password Cracking:** Employ John the Ripper to crack captured password hashes and assess password security.
- **Lab Environment Setup:** Configure AWS instances with Windows 11 and Ubuntu for a diverse testing environment.

## Lab Environment

To conduct this lab, the following components are required:
- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- Terminal access (Terminus or any preferred terminal)
- RDP Client for accessing Windows instances


## Conclusion

By following this documentation, you can simulate and analyze network security scenarios using Responder and John the Ripper. This lab setup is instrumental in learning and demonstrating ethical hacking techniques focused on system hacking and password vulnerability assessment.
